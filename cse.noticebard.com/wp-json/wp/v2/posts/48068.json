The system should analyse non-invasive behavioural inputs like mouse movements, keystroke patterns, and activity shifts to calculate a dynamic risk score. It should proactively address flagged risks while maintaining a seamless experience for both candidates and administrators.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Multilingual Conversational Loan Advisor<\/strong>: Build a multilingual conversational AI assistant that helps users understand loan eligibility, guides them through the loan application process, and provides basic financial literacy tips. The assistant should be able to interact with users via voice or text and support multiple languages.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Solving Peak-Hour Demand Imbalance &amp; Reducing Ride Denials<\/strong>: One of the biggest challenges in urban mobility is the imbalance between supply and demand during peak hours. Riders often struggle to find autos when they need them the most, while drivers may reject trips due to traffic, distance, or fare concerns. This leads to lost earnings for drivers and frustration for customers, ultimately affecting Namma Yatri\u2019s growth and brand trust.<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mode<\/strong> <\/h2><p>Offline<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Prizes<\/strong><\/h2><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Total Prize pool worth Rs. 3 Lakhs (For each&nbsp;Track).<\/li>\n\n<li>Exclusive&nbsp;Sarvam AI credits worth 5K&nbsp;for winners.<\/li>\n\n<li>Exclusive&nbsp;cloud credits&nbsp;for the winners.<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Eligibility<\/strong> <\/h2><p>The hackathon welcomes all college students from across India, irrespective of the degree they are pursuing and for under graduate(UG) students and post graduate(PG) students only.
