In 1886, Jamsetji Tata conceived of a university of science that would work for the benefit of India, and in 1898 created an endowment for establishing such an institution. The Government of India then took up the effort, and, in consultation with scientists in England and in India, decided to locate the Institute in Bengaluru, where the Maharaja of Mysore, Shri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, donated 372 acres of land. The Institute was formally vested in 1909, the foundation stone was laid in 1911, and the first batch of students started their studies in the same year.<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Project <\/strong><\/h2><p>Applications are invited through the online form only for the following assignments in a purely time-bound research project undertaken in this institute.
