It teaches you how to listen to someone in distress and\/or feeling suicidal and understand suicide and the experience of someone thinking of suicide or self-harm. It also brings you in touch with your attitudes and feelings so we can hold a space for others in a non-judgmental, non-advisory and empathetic way.<\/p><p>We look at loss, grief and other related aspects and how to support through listening. Mindfulness and self-care are two other important training components that aid us in holding space. (Please note: This training is in English.
