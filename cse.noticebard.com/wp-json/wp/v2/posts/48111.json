The General Council is the apex body of the Institute, chaired by Hon\u2019ble Lt. Governor of Delhi and the Board of Governors is the policy and decision-making body of the Institute. The Senate is empowered to make all academic decisions.<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>About Summer School<\/strong><\/h2><p>The Summer School is being organized in conjunction with the pre-conference satellite workshop for ICASSP 2025, titled \u201cCrossroads of Machine Learning and Signal Processing,\u201d which will be held in New Delhi from April 2nd to 3rd, 2025.<\/p><p>The workshop will address the challenges of acquiring complex, hidden, weak, and distant signals, which are often difficult to measure. For example, an airborne radar\u2019s swath is limited when using a conventional phased array antenna, and imaging a three-dimensional object with a single sensor is a tedious process. Additionally, in optics, the lack of advanced phase retrieval techniques makes it difficult to accurately estimate complex signals from magnitude-only diffraction patterns. Once a signal is acquired, further algorithms are needed to sample, process, and enhance the data for useful information.<\/p><p>In this context, synthetic aperture (SA) systems have gained prominence in signal processing applications. These systems offer improved signal acquisition and information extraction beyond what is possible with a single sensor. SA is generated by moving an antenna, sensor, or probe to various spatial locations to record phase-coherent measurement samples over a broader volume. The most notable application of SA is in radar remote sensing. For instance, in synthetic aperture radar (SAR), an antenna mounted on an aircraft uses constant velocity motion along the flight path, resulting in a Doppler shift that aids in imaging a ground scene with cross-range resolution proportional to the aircraft&#8217;s path length during the coherent processing interval.<\/p><p>SA also plays a crucial role in channel sounding applications, where the propagation characteristics of a static wireless environment are analyzed. Here, a robot or mechanical positioner moves the antenna to capture phase-coherent samples from multiple spatial locations, which are then combined in post-processing to generate high-resolution angle estimates of signal sources and scatterers.<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Organization Committee<\/strong><\/h2><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>General Chairs<\/strong>: Kumar Vijay Mishra, United States DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, USA, and Shobha Sundar Ram, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, India<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Technical Chairs<\/strong>: Raghu Raj, US Naval Research Laboratory, USA, and Muralidhar Rangaswamy, US Air Force Research Laboratory<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Target Audeince<\/strong><\/h2><p>Graduate students (M.Tech, PhD Students), young professionals, early career academics.<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Register?<\/strong><\/h2><p>Interested candidates can register <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSeqRto3bHQHFd_Yr0_v-418xgCQRTK0Yx9w8i3mlaS7RsWuCw\/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSeqRto3bHQHFd_Yr0_v-418xgCQRTK0Yx9w8i3mlaS7RsWuCw\/viewform\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">via this link<\/a>.<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Contact Details<\/strong><\/h2><p>shobha[at]iiitd.ac.in<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Venue<\/strong><\/h2><p>Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology New Delhi, Okhla Phase III, New Delhi 110020, India<\/p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/2025.ieeeicassp.org\/synthetic-aperture-summer-school\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/2025.ieeeicassp.org\/synthetic-aperture-summer-school\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here to view the official notification for the 2025 Summer School on Synthetic Aperture Imaging for Radar, Sonar, and Optics.<\/a><\/strong><\/h4><p><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Online registrations window is open for the 2025 Summer School on Synthetic Aperture Imaging for Radar, Sonar, and Optics at IIIT Delhi.
